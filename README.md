# atm_machine
This python project faciliates auto-trading by coordinating TradingView alerts, ByBit APIs, and Telegram. The project involves real-time price monitoring via websockets and it involves archiving trading statuses in PostgreSQL. atm_machine was a private personal project and I chose to make it public for those who want to program a similar thing.
