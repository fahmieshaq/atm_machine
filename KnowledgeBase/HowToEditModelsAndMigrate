1. When you create models.py for the first time, you need to do $ flask db init ---> create migrations folder
and then do $ flask db migrate ---> migrates whatever in migrations folder to db you specified in database uri 'postgresql://dbuser:123456@localhost/atm_machine'
Finally, do

$ flask db upgrade

2. Whenever you update models.py, you first have to migrate $ flask db migrate ---> migrates new changes
and then you need to call $ flask db upgrade ---> to push your changes to postgres

If you keep getting errors upgrading postgres with your new changes, do:

$ flask db stamp head ---> To set the revision in the database to the head, without performing any migrations. You can change head to the required change you want.
$ flask db migrate
$ flask db upgrade

To validate whether your changes moved to postgres or not, access the database under the username of database URI:

(atm-machine-iQtW-nJS-py3.8) fahmi@DESKTOP-Q13G500:/mnt/c/users/owner/desktop/atm_machine$ psql -d atm_machine -U dbuser -W -h 127.0.0.1
atm_machine=> \dt ---> list all tables
atm_machine=> \d+ tv_alert ---> list all columns of a table
